#  Pre Lab 2

## Summary
This lab contains template functions that can be used with both the Vector and Linked List classes that were created last week.

## Installation
IDE : Xcode Version 10.2.1 (10E1001) OS: macOS Monterrey version 14.4

## Directory structure
user.cpp has main function of the program and functions used inside main() mylist.hpp and myvector.hpp has the declaration and definition of Lorem class

## Usage
Automated run in Xcode. The PAYLOAD.cpp file has a flag that can be used to test the code. The user.cpp file has all the versions of the tasks.

## Description
For this project there are several template functions:
- show() prints each element in the data structure
- modify() erases the first letter of each element in the structure
- remove_back() removes elements from the tail of the data structure
- remove_front() removes elements from the head of data strucutre
- fill_back() add elements to the back of the data structure
- fill_front() adds elements to the front of the data structure
All of this functions are defined in the user.cpp file and called in the main function of that same file
